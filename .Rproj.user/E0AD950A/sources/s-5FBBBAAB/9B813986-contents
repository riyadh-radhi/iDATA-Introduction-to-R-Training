###### Questions ########

# 1) Create a data frame that has the following:
#   a) one column called "names" that contains
#      the names of your group members

#   b) one column called "height_in_cm" that contains
#      the height of your group members in cm 

#   c) one column called "fav_movie" 
#      that contains the name of the favorite movie of your group members

my_df <- data.frame(
  names = c("Adham","Jafar","Yasir"),
  height_in_cm = c(250,300,350),
  fav_movie = c("Dr.strange","Fury","Avatar")
  )

# 2) find the average height of your group

mean(my_df$height_in_cm)

# 3) Append new column to your data frame that contains
#   the height of your group members in meters called "height_in_m"

my_df$height_in_m <- my_df$height_in_cm / 100

# 4) create any sequence of even numbers that has the same length 
#   as your data frame using the function seq()


even_num_sequence <- seq(from = 0,
                         to = 4,
                         length.out = nrow(my_df))

# 5) Append the sequence created to your data frame and give the new 
#   column a proper name

my_df$great_sequence <- even_num_sequence


# 6) What is the total number of columns in your data frame now?
#   (find a function that returns the number of columns of a data frame)

ncol(my_df)
